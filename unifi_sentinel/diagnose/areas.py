"""Areas: the groups of checks ``diagnose --only`` and ``--skip`` choose between.

An area is a set of finding-code prefixes (``port`` and ``link`` make the ``ports`` area), so the area of any
finding follows from its code and a new code needs no extra registration, as long as its prefix is listed here
(``tests/test_diagnose_areas.py`` fails otherwise). A check function can emit codes of more than one area (the
health check also reports devices waiting for adoption), so ``CHECKS`` lists, for each function, every area it
can emit; it runs when any of them is selected and its findings are then filtered to the selected areas.

``needs_for`` is what a selection has to read from the controller, so ``--only ports`` reads no speedtests and
``--skip events`` sends no event-log request. The tests prove that reading less never changes the findings of the
selected areas.
